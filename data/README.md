# Data Directory

This directory contains the input data files used for analyzing early-onset colon cancer trends across global populations.

## **Main Files**

### **1. `colon_cancer_full.csv` (7.9 MB)**

**Description:** Foundational dataset for all analyses in the project. Contains registry-level colon cancer incidence data from the [IARC CI5plus (Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Plus)](https://ci5.iarc.fr/ci5plus/). In addition to core cancer surveillance variables, the dataset includes socioeconomic and geographic context sourced separately from other global datasets, and merged into the main file. This integration enables stratified analyses by socioeconomic status and geography, supporting robust cross-country and cross-regional comparisons in your project. The merged dataset is the basis for all modeling, trend analysis, and reporting.

**Source:**

- [CI5plus Summary database](https://gco.iarc.fr/media/ci5/data/ci5plus/CI5plus_Summary.zip). Tabulated annual records of multi-decade surveillance data covering ~48 countries across multiple continents
- United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) [Human Development Index (HDI) Reports](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index#/indicies/HDI) 
- International Organization for Standardization (ISO) [3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Officially_assigned_code_elements) Wikipedia article. Codes for the representation of names of countries and their subdivisions – Part 1
- United Nations (UN) [Standard country or area codes for statistical use (M49)](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/overview)
- ISO Country & Regional Codes (Curated Aggregation by [Luke Maurer](https://github.com/lukes/ISO-3166-Countries-with-Regional-Codes). Accessed: 2025-09-07:) This curated CSV aggregates several publicly available standards into a single cleaned dataset for ease of use. All underlying data sources are cited separately
- Global Data Lab [UK Subnational regions HDI](https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/table/2022/shdi+lifexp+lgnic/GBR/) (England, Wales, Northern Island and Scotland)
- Wikipedia [US territories HDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_Human_Development_Index_score) (Puerto Rico)

**Structure:**

- `cases`: Number of colon cancer cases (integer, can be zero).
- `py`: Person-years at risk (float).
- `year`: Year of observation (integer).
- `registry_code`: Code for the cancer registry (string/integer).
- `sex_label`: Sex of the population group (e.g., Male, Female).
- `country`: Country name.
- `continent`: Continent name.
- `region`: Sub-region within the continent.
- `hdi`: Human Development Index value (float).
- `hdi_category`: HDI category (e.g., Medium).
- `age_cont`: Continuous age value (float, e.g., 17.5).
- `age_group`: Age group label (e.g., Young, Old).

The `age_cont` variable represents the midpoint of the original registry age-bands as a continuous value (e.g., 17.5, 22.5, ...). Using the midpoint allows for smoother modeling of age effects and facilitates comparisons across categorical age bands.

**Usage:** This is the **primary input file** for all analyses. Required to reproduce results.

### **2. `hdi_2023.csv` (3.4 KB)**

**Description:** Human Development Index (HDI) values for countries included in the analysis.

**Source:** [UNDP](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index#/indicies/HDI)

- Report: Latest HDI Dataset
- Year: 2023 HDI values

**Structure:**

- Country names
- HDI scores (0-1 scale)

**Usage:** Used to stratify countries by development level and explore socioeconomic patterns in cancer trends.

### **3. `HDR25_Statistical_Annex_HDI_Table.xlsx` (44 KB)**

**Description:** Human Development Index and components.

**Source:** [UNDP Human Development Report (2025)](https://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/2025_HDR/HDR25_Statistical_Annex_HDI_Table.xlsx)

- Original HDI statistical annex from UNDP Human Development Report.

**Usage:** Source file from which `hdi_2023.csv` was extracted. Retained for provenance and transparency.
