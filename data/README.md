## 📊 **Tracked Files (Included in Repository)**

### **1. `colon_cancer_full.csv` (7.9 MB)**

**Description:** Primary dataset containing colon cancer incidence data from the CI5plus database.

**Source:** IARC CI5plus (Cancer Incidence in Five Continents Plus)

- Database: [https://ci5.iarc.fr/](https://ci5.iarc.fr/)
- Time period: Multi-decade surveillance data
- Geographic coverage: ~48 countries across multiple continents

**Structure:**

- Cancer incidence counts by:
  - Country/Registry
  - Year
  - Age group (5-year bands, focus on ages 20-49)
  - Sex
  - Population denominators

**Usage:** This is the **primary input file** for all analyses. Required to reproduce results.

---

### **2. `hdi_2023.csv` (3.4 KB)**

**Description:** Human Development Index (HDI) values for countries included in the analysis.

**Source:** United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)

- Report: Human Development Report 2023
- Year: 2023 HDI values

**Structure:**

- Country names
- HDI scores (0-1 scale)
- HDI categories (Very High, High, Medium, Low)

**Usage:** Used to stratify countries by development level and explore socioeconomic patterns in cancer trends.

---

### **3. `HDR25_Statistical_Annex_HDI_Table.xlsx` (44 KB)**

**Description:** Original HDI statistical annex from UNDP Human Development Report.

**Source:** UNDP Human Development Report 2023/2024

- Official statistical annex
- Comprehensive HDI tables with historical trends

**Usage:** Source file from which `hdi_2023.csv` was extracted. Retained for provenance and transparency.

### **`colon_cancer_full_with_nb_preds.csv` (13 MB)**

**Generated by:** Negative Binomial model predictions
**Script:** `notebooks/03_poisson-NB-regression.ipynb`
**Contains:** Original data + Negative Binomial model predictions

### **`country_aggregated_df2.csv` (484 KB)**

**Generated by:** Data aggregation step
