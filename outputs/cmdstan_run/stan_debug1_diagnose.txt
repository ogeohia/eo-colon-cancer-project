Checking sampler transitions treedepth.
458 of 1200 (38.17%) transitions hit the maximum treedepth limit of 12, or 2^12 leapfrog steps.
Trajectories that are prematurely terminated due to this limit will result in slow exploration.
For optimal performance, increase this limit.

Checking sampler transitions for divergences.
12 of 1200 (1.00%) transitions ended with a divergence.
These divergent transitions indicate that HMC is not fully able to explore the posterior distribution.
Try increasing adapt delta closer to 1.
If this doesn't remove all divergences, try to reparameterize the model.

Checking E-BFMI - sampler transitions HMC potential energy.
E-BFMI satisfactory.

Rank-normalized split effective sample size satisfactory for all parameters.

Rank-normalized split R-hat values satisfactory for all parameters.

Processing complete.
